1. Install Apache, Mysql, PHP stack (we recommend using AMPPS stack on Windows because it's our development environment, it has all the PHP extension we need to run this project
2. Open AMPPS=>PHP an change PHP version to 5.5 (this is our development environment, it's up to you to choose what version of PHP, but again, we recommend PHP verion 5.5
3. Install Phalcon extension (we recommend using Windows because install Phalcon extension on Windows is the easiest way compare to Linux and Max OS)
http://phalconphp.com/en/download/windows
- Download the right DLL with right version of Apache, Mysql, PHP stack
- Place the DLL in C:\Ampps\php\ext (if your installation folder is C:\Ampps)
- Open C:/Ampps/conf/php-5.5.ini in Notepad Add extension=php_phalcon.dll at end of file and save
- Restart Apache
You can refer to this topic http://forum.phalconphp.com/discussion/844/installation-on-ampps
4. Copy our project to \www folder. The result will be C:\Ampps\www\ebookdungeon
5. Set Document Root to \www\ebookdungeon (so we just need to use http://localhost to enter our website)
6. Create folder "upload" in \www\ebookdungeon if it was not created
7. Create database "ebookdungeon" by Mysql Workbench or PHPmyadmin. Open file create_table.sql in "ebookdungeon" folder, run that script by Mysql Workbench or PHPmyadmin
8. In order to use Admin section, open C:\Ampps\www\ebookdungeon\admin, create new folder "cache", then in folder "cache", create folder "volt" (because Volt template engine of Phalcon required this)
9. In order to upload large files, open php.ini and set
- upload_max_filesize 1000M
- post_max_size 1000M
- max_input_time 6000
- max_execution_time 6000
If you don't do this, you can't upload file larger than 2 MB (because it's default in php.ini)
